Resources
=========

** Figs: Illustrations is still working on the figs. 
   9 total. (0 are informal; 0 are inline.)

   Once the figs are processed on /work, you'll need to add them to the book's repo.

   A report mapping original figure file names to their new names can be found in the tools folder for this project as figure_renaming_report.tsv.

** Intake Report:
   (Git repo) tools/intakereport.txt

** MS Snapshot:
    To view the submitted files, you'll need to checkout the git tag named 'manuscript_to_prod' 
    by running the following command in your checkout:
    
    $ git checkout manuscript_to_prod
    
    This will temporarily switch the files in your repo to the state they were in when the manuscript_to_prod tag 
    was created. 
    To switch the files back to the current state, run:
    
    $ git checkout main
  
  
Notes from Tools:
=================

** PROD: Add any authors to project that need to be added.
** Syntax highlighting: applied to 128 out of 130 code listings.

** I left the lexer calls to qasm in case you want to do find replace. The author will have to decide on a different lexer that we have. If they don't want to use a different lexer then just delete all the [source,qasm] lines.
** There are a lot of inline images in this one. By default we don't rename those files, so that's why there's so many files with the same name as the draft figs.

** Please let Tools know ASAP if there are any other global problems for which we can help automate a fix.


Notes at arrival in production:
==================

Notes for production:
* Fig log: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17p7i5h-BzejGvPCfE3kL14C2ZMW0ebNzyUAioQx-HQ0/edit#gid=0
* No art issues, but almost everything is a redraw.
* One UK author and one US author, so voice will need consistency
* The authors are hoping for publication in mid-June; it's on the last June FTP right now, but I'm making it a July ERD until we see how it goes.

==================

Please let me know about any other issues.

Thanks,
-Nick
